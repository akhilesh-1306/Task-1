# Availability Scheduler

## Overview
Availability Scheduler is a web application that allows users to manage their availability schedules. Users can view, add, edit, and delete their availability slots, making it easier to organize their time and share their schedule with others.

## Features
- View all availability slots in a user-friendly interface
- Add new availability slots
- Edit existing availability slots
- Delete availability slots
- Responsive design for various screen sizes

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm (v6 or later)
- MongoDB (v4 or later)

### Backend Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone .....
   cd backend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the backend directory with the following content:
   ```
   PORT=8080
   MONGODB_URI="url"
   JWT_SECRET="secret-12345"
   ```

4. Start the backend server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

### Frontend Setup
1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```
   cd ../frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the frontend development server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

## System Architecture

The Availability Scheduler follows a client-server architecture:

1. Frontend:
   - Built with React.js
   - Uses React Bootstrap for UI components
   - Communicates with the backend via RESTful API calls

2. Backend:
   - Built with Node.js and Express.js
   - Uses MongoDB for data storage
   - Implements JWT for authentication

3. Database:
   - MongoDB stores user information and availability slots

## Design Choices

1. React.js for Frontend:
   - Offers a component-based architecture for reusability and maintainability
   - Provides efficient rendering with its virtual DOM

2. React Bootstrap:
   - Ensures a consistent and responsive design across devices
   - Provides pre-built components for faster development

3. Express.js for Backend:
   - Lightweight and flexible Node.js framework
   - Easy to set up RESTful APIs

4. MongoDB:
   - Flexible schema for easy modifications as the project evolves
   - Good performance for read and write operations

5. JWT Authentication:
   - Stateless authentication mechanism
   - Scalable and secure for web applications

## Development Considerations

1. Security:
   - Implemented JWT for secure authentication
   - Ensured all API endpoints are protected
   - Used environment variables for sensitive information

2. Scalability:
   - Designed the backend to be stateless, allowing for horizontal scaling
   - Used efficient database queries to handle a growing number of users and availability slots

3. User Experience:
   - Implemented a responsive design for various devices
   - Added confirmation dialogs for destructive actions (e.g., deleting availability slots)
   - Used color-coding and visual cues to make the interface intuitive

4. Code Quality:
   - Followed React best practices and hooks for state management
   - Implemented error handling on both frontend and backend
   - Used consistent coding style and naming conventions

5. Future Improvements:
   - Implement pagination for large numbers of availability slots
   - Add user roles and permissions for team scheduling
   - Integrate with calendar applications (e.g., Google Calendar, Outlook)
   - Implement real-time updates using WebSockets
